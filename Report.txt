For initialization, we generated the k random means as k random number between the smallest number and largest number in the 
dataset, then calculated their variance according to each of their randomly generated means. The results are sometimes sensitive 
to the initial values, but that depends on the value of k.

I think the true k is k = 3. When run every time, although the initial 3 means are wildly different, it always converges 
to the same 3 means and variances.

(Extra Credit): During our E-step we multiply the numerator and denominator by alpha, while we do not do that in the 
slides.
